  <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p>

  <p>âœ¨Have a great day!âœ¨</p>
  <p>There was once a boy who was born the colour of indigo
Mother, father, everyone didn't know â€™til he hit the floor
Born inside a prison and missing, something immaculate
Ain't got no mortality, take his parents aback a bit
Careful what you wish for, your piss poor
Decisions get you set back just a bit more
You sucking on a sack of dicks
Lack the wit to kill a demon screaming it's a sack he hit
Wacky kid, as in he a goofy one, tacky shit
You be done
If you really evil, he can start a war
All his homies dying
Now his heart is cold, particle
Weapons from the gods that incinerate and irradiate
Stepping on the dirt, hate can turn the earth to a scary place
All the gods we know have to die
All the gods we know have to die
No one knows where they lie
But they live on inside your mind
You can be whatever that you find is fine
So he won the war that many people said was great
Went into the wood for a minute to meditate
But there was no devil to influence him to break
Just a hungry hunter who wanted some wild steak
Wait
Do I see a foot in the distance?
I'mma aim, ainâ€™t no missing
I gotta feed all of my children
Bitch listen, bitch listen
Let the arrow fly and see an era end
I'm not terrified, you're a long-lost friend
See, in a past life, you were a man, I took your life away
Now it was your pass at me, I forgive you on any day
Karma is a bitch and she slapping with tight hooks
Armor on my head but it jabbed in my right foot
That was the way Lord Krishna died (uh)
Flew up in the sky, what a radical guy (uh)</p>
