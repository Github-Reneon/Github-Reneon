  <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p>

  <p>âœ¨Have a great day!âœ¨</p>
  <HR>
  <p>There was once a boy who was born the colour of indigo</p>
<p>Mother, father, everyone didn't know â€™til he hit the floor</p>
<p>Born inside a prison and missing, something immaculate</p>
<p>Ain't got no mortality, take his parents aback a bit</p>
<p>Careful what you wish for, your piss poor</p>
<p>Decisions get you set back just a bit more</p>
<p>You sucking on a sack of dicks</p>
<p>Lack the wit to kill a demon screaming it's a sack he hit</p>
<p>Wacky kid, as in he a goofy one, tacky shit</p>
<p>You be done</p>
<p>If you really evil, he can start a war</p>
<p>All his homies dying</p>
<p>Now his heart is cold, particle</p>
<p>Weapons from the gods that incinerate and irradiate</p>
<p>Stepping on the dirt, hate can turn the earth to a scary place</p>
<p>All the gods we know have to die</p>
<p>All the gods we know have to die</p>
<p>No one knows where they lie</p>
<p>But they live on inside your mind</p>
<p>You can be whatever that you find is fine</p>
<p>So he won the war that many people said was great</p>
<p>Went into the wood for a minute to meditate</p>
<p>But there was no devil to influence him to break</p>
<p>Just a hungry hunter who wanted some wild steak</p>
<p>Wait</p>
<p>Do I see a foot in the distance?</p>
<p>I'mma aim, ainâ€™t no missing</p>
<p>I gotta feed all of my children</p>
<p>Bitch listen, bitch listen</p>
<p>Let the arrow fly and see an era end</p>
<p>I'm not terrified, you're a long-lost friend</p>
<p>See, in a past life, you were a man, I took your life away</p>
<p>Now it was your pass at me, I forgive you on any day</p>
<p>Karma is a bitch and she slapping with tight hooks</p>
<p>Armor on my head but it jabbed in my right foot</p>
<p>That was the way Lord Krishna died (uh)</p>
<p>Flew up in the sky, what a radical guy (uh)</p>
